Q: What are the "Terms of Use/Service"?
A: By donating, you understand that your donation is actually a donation, and comes without obligation of services.
As a "gift", you will gain access to the private repo, where you understand that access to the private repo is primarily for early access to new scripts, new versions of scripts, and features that may sometime in the future be made public.
While Kain generally helps users who need help with scripts, and sometimes even adds features on request, you understand that there is no obligation that Kain must do so.
